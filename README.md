# Stock-Analysis
Pursuing the American dream, trying to make a cheap buck. This time with data.

The goal of this repo is to be able to pull past stock data, analyze it for trends, and finally make decisions about buying and selling based on these past trends and the current price. I am particularly interested in price fluctuations around the ex-dividend and payment dates for dividends as I believe these will show the largest fluctuations.

Right now, I am able to pull data from Yahoo Finance concerning historical stock prices. Unfortunately, this data only offers the date, open, close, high, low, and adjusted close prices as well as the volume. From this I will be able to generate nice looking candlestick plots, but I would like most high frequency data, preferably minute by minute rather than day by day data.
